<p>Women’s health is a vital part of a well-rounded education but often be ignored form time to time especially in developing countries. This leads to the misleading assumptions and lack of awareness in the society and such that youngsters, especially girls, don’t have a clear understanding of themselves. Also, many find it difficult to share their experiences and express their concerns. </p>

<p>Hence, we realize the significance of popularizing knowledge of women’s health, promoting girls’ empowerment and fulfillment of their human rights. Taking inspiration from this, we decide to make a mini game to make it more interactive, fun, and accessible so that whoever learns can pick up lessons of their interests covering a range of topics.
